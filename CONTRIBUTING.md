# General

I am always open to improvements and suggestions. Use issues at
https://github.com/Tux/Spreadsheet-Read/issues

# Style

I will never accept pull request that do not strictly conform to my
style, however you might hate it. You can read the reasoning behind
my preferences here: http://tux.nl/style.html

I really do not care about mixed spaces and tabs in (leading) whitespace

# Requirements

The minimum version required to use this module is stated in Makefile.PL
That does however not guarantee that it will work for all underlying
parsers, as they might require newer perl versions.

# New parsers

I am all open to support new parsers. The closer the API is to that of
Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, the easier it will be to support it.
